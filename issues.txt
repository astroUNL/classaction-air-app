The "Proton-Proton" and "CNO Cycle" animations (sunsolarenergy/fusion01.swf and sunsolarenergy/fusion02.swf) start
immediately, without the buttons being pressed. I found what appear to be the FLAs for these files (dated 6/8/2009)
but my copy of Flash CS4 gives an "Unexpected File Format" error and crashes when trying to open them.
