The ClassAction app contains over 500 dynamic peer instructions for intro astronomy, as well as more than 100 simulations, animations, and other resources.

This ClassAction project was originally Flash-based and available on the web at [astro.unl.edu/classaction](https://astro.unl.edu/classaction/). It has now been packaged into standalone executables for Mac and Windows using Adobe AIR technology.

To download the latest compiled executables please visit [astro.unl.edu/downloads](https://astro.unl.edu/downloads/).
